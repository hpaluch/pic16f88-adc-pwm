# ADC and PWM on PIC16F88

Demo project to read potentiometer value using ADC and output PWM to LED.
I use it to learn how to use ADC and PWM on [PIC16F88][PIC16F88]. 

What it does (in a loop, around every 10ms):
1. Read potentiometer value using ADC, on `RA0/AN0/PIN17`, ADC produces
    10-bit value from 0 to 1023 (0x3ff)
1. set LED brightness on `RB0/INT/CCP1/PIN6` using PWM - duty based on ADC value, PWM frequency
   is fixed at 1 kHz
1. Blinks LED on `RA1/AN1/PIN18`, period based on ADC value, the shortest period is 50ms,
   longest is 1s

Used HW:
- [PICDEM Lab Development Kit][DM163045] 
- [PIC16F88][PIC16F88] - included with latest series of [DM163045][DM163045]

Schematic is below:

## PWM math

Have to combine data from:
- [PIC16F88][PIC16F88], page 84, section `9.3 PWM Mode`
- [DS40001369C][DS40001369C], page 98, section `9.2.2 PWM Period`
- [DS31014A][DS31014A], page 210 (14-8), section `14.5. PWM Mode`

According to [PIC16F88][PIC16F88]  datasheet, page 84, section 9.3.1 PWM Period there is:
```math
PWM_{per} = \frac{ ( PR2 + 1 ) \ast 4 \ast TMR2 }{ F_{osc} }
```

So
```math
PR2 + 1 =  \frac{ PWM_{per} \ast F_{osc} }{ 4 \ast TMR2_{presc}  }
```
And finally:
```math
PR2 = \frac{ PWM_{per} \ast F_{osc} }{ 4 \ast TMR2_{presc}  } - 1
```
Or
```math
PR2 = \frac{ F_{osc} }{ 4 \ast TMR2_{presc} \ast PWM_{freq}  } - 1
```
Example for expected $PWM_{freq} = 1000$ Hz)
```math
PR2 = \frac{  4 000 000 }{ 4 \ast 1 \ast 1 000 } - 1 =  \frac{ 4 000 000 }{ 4 000 } - 1 = 99
```
So $PR2$ should be $99$.

Now we need to compute value Pulse Width 10-bit register CCPR. Let's say we want
Pulse Width 25% = Ratio 0.25 (ratio is from 0 to 0.99999). The formula is:
```math
DutyRatio = \frac{ CCPR_{10bit} }{ 4 \ast ( PR2 + 1 ) }
```
Thus
```math
CCPR_{10bit} = DutyRatio  \ast 4 \ast (PR2 + 1 ) = DutyRatio \ast 400
```
For ratio 25% => 0.25 we get $CCPR_{10bit} = 0.25 \ast 400 = 100 $
