# ADC and PWD on PIC16F88

Project goal: read potentiometer value using ADC and output PWM to LED.

WORK IN PROGRESS! Status:
- Done:
  - Reading potentiometer value using ADC, on `RA0/AN0/PIN17`
  - blinking LED on `RA1/AN1/PIN18`, `period = ADC * 1 ms`
- ToDo:
  - regulate LED brightness using PWM

Used HW:
- [PICDEM Lab Development Kit][DM163045] 
- [PIC16F88][PIC16F88] - included with latest series of DM163045
